## ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Entanglement

QPool introduces the concept of Entanglement, inspired by quantum mechanics. Just as quantum particles can be entangled so that the state of one instantly affects the other, jobs in an Entanglement share state that persists across time and space. When one job updates the shared state, all other jobs in the entanglement‚Äîeven those not yet processed‚Äîwill see these changes.

This powerful feature enables:
- Shared state between related jobs that persists even across job completion
- Automatic state synchronization for jobs processed at different times
- Immutable history of all state changes
- Perfect for distributed data processing and coordinated task execution

## üì¶Ô∏è Regulators

QPool implements a sophisticated regulation system inspired by biological and mechanical control systems. Like a thermostat regulating temperature or a governor controlling engine speed, Regulators maintain system stability and prevent resource exhaustion through adaptive control mechanisms.

The regulation system includes:

### üö¶ Rate Limiter

A token bucket-based rate limiter that provides smooth, burst-capable traffic control. Like a water tank with controlled inflow and outflow, it ensures operations proceed at a sustainable pace while allowing brief bursts of activity when needed.

- Configurable steady-state rate and burst capacity
- Smooth operation without sharp cutoffs
- Perfect for API rate limiting and resource protection
- Automatic token replenishment

### üîå Circuit Breaker

Inspired by electrical circuit breakers, this pattern prevents system failure by automatically stopping operations when error rates exceed acceptable thresholds. Like its electrical counterpart, it "trips" to protect the system and automatically tests for recovery.

- Prevents cascade failures in distributed systems
- Self-healing with automatic recovery testing
- Configurable error thresholds and recovery timing
- Perfect for protecting external service calls

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
go get github.com/theapemachine/qpool
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "time"
    "github.com/theapemachine/qpool"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new pool with min 2, max 5 workers
    ctx := context.Background()
    pool := qpool.NewQ(ctx, 2, 5, &qpool.Config{
        SchedulingTimeout: time.Second,
    })
    defer pool.Close()

    // Schedule a simple job
    result := pool.Schedule("job-1", func() (any, error) {
        return "Hello, World!", nil
    })

    // Wait for the result
    value := <-result
    if value.Error != nil {
        panic(value.Error)
    }
    println(value.Value.(string))
}
```

## üî® Advanced Usage

### Job Dependencies

QPool supports a robust job dependency system that allows you to create complex workflows. Jobs can depend on one or more other jobs, and the system ensures proper execution order.

```go
// Create jobs with dependencies
job1Result := pool.Schedule("data-fetch", func() (any, error) {
    return fetchData()
}, qpool.WithTTL(time.Minute))

// This job will only execute after data-fetch completes successfully
job2Result := pool.Schedule("data-process", func() (any, error) {
    return processData()
}, qpool.WithDependencies([]string{"data-fetch"}))

// You can also add multiple dependencies
job3Result := pool.Schedule("data-aggregate", func() (any, error) {
    return aggregateData()
}, qpool.WithDependencies([]string{"data-fetch", "data-process"}))

// Configure dependency retry behavior
job4Result := pool.Schedule("data-transform", func() (any, error) {
    return transformData()
}, 
    qpool.WithDependencies([]string{"data-aggregate"}),
    qpool.WithDependencyRetry(3, &qpool.ExponentialBackoff{Initial: time.Second}))

// Process results
for result := range job4Result {
    if result.Error != nil {
        log.Printf("Error: %v", result.Error)
        continue
    }
    // Process the result
    log.Printf("Success: %v", result.Value)
}
```

Key features of the dependency system:
- Jobs wait for all dependencies to complete successfully before starting
- If any dependency fails, dependent jobs fail automatically
- Configurable retry policies for dependency resolution
- Automatic cleanup of completed job results based on TTL
- Non-blocking dependency resolution with timeout handling

### Circuit Breaker

```go
// Add circuit breaker to protect sensitive operations
pool.Schedule("api-call", func() (any, error) {
    return callExternalAPI()
}, qpool.WithCircuitBreaker("api", 5, time.Minute))
```

### Retry Policy

```go
// Configure retry behavior
pool.Schedule("flaky-operation", func() (any, error) {
    return flakyOperation()
}, qpool.WithRetry(3, &qpool.ExponentialBackoff{
    Initial: time.Second,
}))
```

### Broadcast Groups

```go
// Create a broadcast group for pub/sub functionality
group := pool.CreateBroadcastGroup("sensors", time.Minute)
subscriber := pool.Subscribe("sensors")

// Send updates to all subscribers
group.Send(qpool.QuantumValue{
    Value: "sensor-update",
    CreatedAt: time.Now(),
})
```

## üìä Metrics & Monitoring

QPool provides comprehensive metrics for monitoring:

```go
// Get current metrics
metrics := pool.metrics.ExportMetrics()

fmt.Printf("Active Workers: %d\n", metrics["worker_count"])
fmt.Printf("Queue Size: %d\n", metrics["queue_size"])
fmt.Printf("Success Rate: %.2f%%\n", metrics["success_rate"]*100)
fmt.Printf("P95 Latency: %dms\n", metrics["p95_latency"])
```

## üîß Configuration

QPool can be configured through the `Config` struct:

```go
config := &qpool.Config{
    SchedulingTimeout: time.Second * 5,
}

pool := qpool.NewQ(ctx, minWorkers, maxWorkers, config)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

QPool consists of several key components:

-   **Q (Pool)**: Main orchestrator managing workers and job scheduling
-   **Worker**: Handles job execution and resource management
-   **QuantumSpace**: Manages job results and dependencies
-   **CircuitBreaker**: Provides fault tolerance
-   **Scaler**: Handles dynamic worker pool sizing
-   **Metrics**: Collects and exposes performance data

## üìà Performance

QPool is designed for high performance:

-   Non-blocking job scheduling
-   Efficient memory usage
-   Smart resource allocation
-   Automatic scaling based on load
-   Optimized dependency resolution

## üß™ Testing
